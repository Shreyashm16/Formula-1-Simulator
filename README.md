# Formula-1-Simulator


## Functionalities
* Multiple F1 race tracks: 
A choice of race tracks will enable a user to better understand the car and its controls. A different track layout will keep the game fresh
* Minimap: 
It is a small layput of the track displayed on the screen for the user to judge what their next action should be while playing the game
* CV Steering: 
A CV based hand recognition system that will enable a user to drive the car using their hand as the steering
* Menu Screen: 
All games have menus, where a user can choose different settings and options to play. Our game is no different
* Closed Loop Sytem: 
Controls and overall game craft will be designed to be self sufficient. Realistic parameters like slowing of car when off track will be employed
* Lap Times: 
Time taken by a user to drive one lap around the track will be stored, and the target will be to beat this lap record
* Multiple Camera Angles: 
Introducing multiple camera angles like 1st person and 3rd person will add a new dimension to the game, giving it a realistic feel.
